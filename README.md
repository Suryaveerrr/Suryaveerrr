## Hey, I’m Suryaveer Bhandari

I’m interested in games as engineering systems — real-time simulation, gameplay architecture, and intelligent behavior under performance constraints.

My work focuses on gameplay and systems programming, AI-driven mechanics, and modular, maintainable code rather than engine-specific features.

## 🧠 What I Work On
- Gameplay & systems programming (C++ / C#)
- AI behavior systems (FSMs, event-driven logic, pathfinding)
- Real-time interaction & simulation
- Performance-oriented design patterns

---

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
**Languages**
- C++, C#, Python

**Game & Systems**
- Unity (engineering-focused usage)
- Unreal Engine (learning, engine-side exploration)
- OpenGL (fundamentals, graphics pipeline)

**Tools**
- Git, GitHub
- Blender (supporting asset workflow)

## 📌 Selected Work
Most repositories here are experimental prototypes and technical testbeds, used to explore architecture, AI behavior, and system-level design in interactive environments.
