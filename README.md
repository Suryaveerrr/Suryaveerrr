## Hey, I’m Suryaveer 

I’m into games, but not just the “press button → fun happens” part.  
I care about the systems underneath — the code that decides *why* something works, *why* it breaks, and *why* it suddenly drops to 20 FPS.

I mostly work on gameplay and systems programming, AI behavior, and real-time interaction. I enjoy building things that are modular, maintainable, and only mildly hostile to future-me.

## Things I Spend Too Much Time On
- Gameplay & systems programming (C++ / C#)
- AI behavior systems (FSMs, pathfinding, NPCs that almost feel smart)
- Real-time simulation & performance problems I caused myself
- Writing code that doesn’t immediately collapse when I add one feature

---

## Stuff I Use (and Sometimes Fight With)
**Languages**
- C++, C#, Python

**Game & Systems**
- Unity (used as an engineering playground, not magic)
- Unreal Engine (slowly poking at the engine side)
- OpenGL (because I wanted to know what the GPU is actually doing)

**Other Tools**
- Git & GitHub (my emotional support version control)
- Blender (when code alone can’t save me)

## What Lives in This Repo
Prototypes, experiments, and technical testbeds.  
Some are polished. Some are “learning experiences.”  
All of them taught me something — usually about architecture or humility.
